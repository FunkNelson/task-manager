# Task Manager
Python to-do list application, written by Morgan Ross.


## Installation and usage
Clone repo locally and run with `python3 main.py`.  Select action from the options list by entering the corresponding number.

The application creates two files in the local directory :

1. task_file.txt

    - Chronological list of pending tasks in the format `CURRENT TASK | DATE ENTERED`

2. completed_tasks.txt

    - Chronological list of completed tasks in the format `COMPLETED TASK | DATE ENTERED | DATE COMPLETED`


Neither file requires manual editing.
